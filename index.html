            <h3>HACKING DOWN TREES FOR CLIMATE SUMMIT - IRONY AT ITS PEAK.</h3>
            <p class="post-summary">
                Hacking Down Trees of The Amazon for A Climate Summit- Is that so? 
                The sheer irony is- world leaders are congregating to discuss about ‘saving the planet’, while making it to the destination and standing there on a freshly deforested land, faking not to notice the motorized saw buzzing in the backdrop. Being real unravels that the road was never for the trees but rather is surely for the industries that boom on deforestation, which they seize for reachability. Probably following year’s summit will be held in a space station, only for continuing the irony.
                Officials are implementing an official four-lane highway construction in the Amazon while using bulldozers to destroy forest area for simple access to climate summit, in a scenario that resembles environmental satire. Out gist to fight climate change lies in the rainforest, but we are tossing it away to make mere quick convenience. Allegedly the Amazon forest would be displaying an obvious eye roll if forests possessed that ability...
                <span class="more-text"> Here emerges an outrageous epiphany that perhaps drilling sustainability would be a really better idea instead of just being preached. Planetary technology provides both virtual meetings alongside eco-friendly transport alternatives options 
                    throughout the world. Instead, we observe another example of leaders requiring actions they clearly refrain from. Climate summit in the future could become meetings to develop air-conditioned dooms which will enable survival for our environmental mishaps.
                    This reflects the method to achieve a better smoke detector 
                    requires burning down your whole house. How irrational that sounds! Protecting the remaining environment should be the core objective of climate action instead of being dedicated to construction that for the sake of convenience. Natural forests 
                    will continue to disappear until decision-makers grasp this fundamental concept despite their self-congratulations about ‘saving the planet’.</span>

            <p class="post-summary">
                “Rivers are Dying-One Fish’s Journey Could Be Ours”
                Searching for her family, Ripple a small Hilsa fish, rushed through the once powerful Padma River. But the water was murky and stained with oil and plastic. Her ancestors had spawned in the sludge-covered riverbed for generations.
                <span class="more-text"> “Where is everyone?” Dodging a flying bottle, Ripple gasped. She passed dead fish that were caught in nets left behind by reckless fishermen. The current, once her guide, was now weak, choked by dams upstream.
                    Tired, she discovered an elderly turtle. “Little one,” he murmured, “the river is dying.” “None of us can survive without it.”
                    However, Ripple refused to give up. “I will fight for my home!” she declared. 
                    The battle of Ripple comes as a warning on the International Day of Action for Rivers. If rivers disappear, so do the life forms within them. Protect the river because every drop lost is a life lost. Before it’s too late, will we take action?</span>
